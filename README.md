# FindFavMovies

FindFavMovies is a website platform where users can find a list of popular, now-playing, top-rated, & upcoming movies and create a list of their own favourites.
This is a personal project by a passionate web developer - Vinay Tambey, created with the sole intent of understanding React.js fundamentals, and honing modern frontend web development skills.

# Learnings
1. **React Router**: Gained hands-on experience with React Router for dynamic routing and navigation between different components, as pages. 
2. **UseEffect() Hook**: Understood the importance of the useEffect() hook by invoking the data fetching upon an initial render of the component, and upon changes to specific state variables triggering re-renders.
3. **React Context API**: Explored & utilized the React Context API for making global state management easier, allowing for seamless data sharing between components without prop drilling.
4. **UseLocation() Hook**: Leveraged the useLocation() hook for refreshing the page in a SPA-friendly way upon every user interaction, by utilizing the location object, and resetting the state, without full-page reload, following React best practices.
5. **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling mechanisms to manage corner-cases, ensuring a smoother user experience and preventing application crashes.
